Use Case Scenarios  
------------------

Scenario 1: Switching Audio Output from Laptop Speakers to External Display  
A user reported that audio was only playing through the laptopâ€™s built-in Realtek speakers, despite having an LG monitor connected via HDMI. Using Audio Output Manager, a technician:
- Connected to the user's machine remotely
- Installed the AudioDeviceCmdlets module
- Listed available playback devices
- Identified the LG display as an available output
- Set the LG display as the default playback device

This resolved the issue without requiring physical access to the machine.

Scenario 2: Preconfiguring Audio Devices for Conference Rooms  
Before a scheduled meeting, technicians can remotely:
- Install the audio module on conference room PCs
- Verify that the correct speaker system is available
- Set the external speaker system as the default device

This ensures consistent audio output across all rooms without manual setup.

Scenario 3: Troubleshooting Audio Failures in Virtual Desktop Environments  
In VDI setups where users experience inconsistent audio routing:
- Technicians can use the tool to inspect available playback devices
- Identify misrouted or inactive endpoints
- Set the correct device as default to restore functionality
